The security of the FTP data and commands are not good but it is still better than BitTorrent.
The data and commands of FTP is not encrypted. So anyone who can intefere with the connection 
can see the whole data. It's still better than BitTorrent because FTP has a authentication protocol
where user has to be validated. FTP is much more secured because the data is encrypted.

Yes, someone can definitely hack into my FTP server. If I don't carefully validate the state and 
the user for every command, the hacker can basically send a error command that cause the socket
to reset, but the server stills think that it has a valid user connected. The hacker can also
intefere with the data connection because it's not encrypted

FTP makes transferring files easy. The mechanism of transferring a file is very simple. It's basically
read and write to a file. FTP is not very secured compared to SFTP. Also, if you don't have a good 
connection, data corruption can happen. FTP does not a reroll mechanism where if a file is sent partially,
it should be deleted

The way we usually implement this is with one command channel and one data channel. Merging these two into
one is very challenging because we have to some how send the data and the signal right after another.
The client will find it very challenging to figure out which one is the command, which one is a data
For example, the client usually validate using status code like 226, 503, etc. What if the data we send
also have these code, then it would be very hard.
