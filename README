Important note:
I highly recommend running this on your local machine. Tux is very unstable for some reason.
Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't

The user and password are located in accounts.txt. You can add more if you want
For testing, please use 'cs472' as USER and 'pass' as PASS

To run the project
`make build`
`python3 main.py LOGNAME PORT`
If you choose a port number below 1024. Please run,
`sudo python3 main.py LOGNAME PORT`
I recommend using sudo all the time for no hassle

I tested this project with the client I created in ASSN 2 and the normal FTP Client it works fine.

My short answers are in answer.txt
