Important note:
I highly recommend running this on your local machine. Tux is very unstable for some reason.
Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't

To run the project
`make build`
`python3 main.py LOGNAME PORT`
If you choose a port number below 1024. Please run,
`sudo python3 main.py LOGNAME PORT`
I recommend using sudo all the time for no hassle

I tested this project with the client I created in ASSN 2 and the normal FTP Client it works fine.
